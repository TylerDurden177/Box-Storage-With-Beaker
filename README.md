# Box-Storage-With-Beaker

There are 3 seperated codes or smart contracts for box storage , 2 in python and 1 in solidity
Also there's a file named "about code" for each explaining what are functions of smart contracts also how can one use 'em , slight changes might be required to be done as per your personal wishes rest is all great with no syntax errors.
Thanks for this opportunity me and my team are grateful !
